### Working together

For each scenario we should proceed the following way

1. Analyze the scenario/requirements and establish a plan/strategy
2. Create the script structure (Think about the performance impact)
3. Split the work if possible (Sections, differents functions...)
4. Assign one person to post the script regularly to get input from Coaches

Additionally we should meet on Google Hangout or take advantage of
* Github issue tracking
* Discussion forum of our team in scriptinggames.org
